# Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Clean Architecture implementation: Presentation ← Domain → Data (reverse dependency flow)
- Custom BLoC pattern replaces flutter_bloc package - manual listener management required
- Feature-based organization with self-contained modules (data/, domain/, presentation/)
- Repository pattern with abstract interfaces in domain, concrete implementations in data
- UseCase pattern for business logic - single responsibility per use case
- Model-Entity separation: Models for data layer, Entities for domain layer
- Widget organization: pages/ separate from widgets/ with barrel exports
- Theme system centralized in core/theme/ with mandatory constants usage
- State management manual - no automatic persistence or restoration
- Navigation incomplete - route constants defined but basic implementation
- API layer inconsistency: constants vs service base URLs
- Local storage via SharedPreferences - not secure for sensitive data
- No dependency injection framework - manual DI in feature initialization
- Authentication state managed locally - no session management
- Error handling strips "Exception: " prefix for user display
- Indonesian UI text throughout - affects internationalization architecture
- Device detection uses arbitrary 600px threshold for tablet/phone
- Logger utility debug-only - no production logging strategy
- Form validation centralized but language-specific
- Date/time formatting localized regardless of system settings
- Performance considerations: manual listener management can cause memory leaks
- Scalability: feature-based structure supports modular growth
- Testing architecture: flutter_test framework but no existing tests
- Build system: standard Flutter with platform-specific configurations
- Deployment: supports Android, iOS, web, Linux, macOS, Windows
- Documentation: comprehensive but primarily in Indonesian
- Code generation: none used - all code handwritten
- State persistence: limited to SharedPreferences for authentication
- Network layer: basic HTTP implementation with custom error handling
- Caching strategy: local storage only, no in-memory caching
- Security: basic token storage without encryption
- Analytics: no implementation currently
- Performance monitoring: manual logging only in debug mode
