# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Comprehensive documentation exists in docs/KataDia_AI_Agent_Guidelines.md (2300+ lines)
- Theme system completely documented in code with 50+ colors, 20+ text styles, spacing system
- Custom BLoC implementation differs from standard flutter_bloc package patterns
- Feature organization counterintuitive: widgets/ separate from pages/ within each feature
- Indonesian UI text throughout - English documentation may not match actual app text
- API base URLs inconsistent between constants and service implementation
- Router implementation incomplete - currently uses basic MaterialPageRoute
- Clean Architecture layers: Presentation ← Domain → Data (not standard order)
- Barrel exports (index.dart) used extensively for clean imports
- State management manual - no automatic state persistence or restoration
- Authentication flow: onboarding → login → home (may skip steps based on state)
- Two navigation systems: route constants vs actual implementation
- Theme constants mandatory but not enforced by linter
- Custom utilities replace standard Flutter/Dart functionality
- Error messages in Indonesian but error handling in English
- File naming conventions: snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes
- No external state management packages - custom implementation only
- Local storage via SharedPreferences - not secure storage for sensitive data
- Device detection uses arbitrary 600px width threshold
- Date/time formatting localized to Indonesian regardless of system locale
- XP formatting with K/M suffixes - not standard number formatting
- Logger utility only works in debug mode - no production logging
- Form validation messages in Indonesian - may confuse English-speaking developers
- Widget organization: one widget per file, no exceptions
- Repository pattern with abstract interfaces in domain layer
- UseCase pattern for business logic - not standard service layer
- Model-Entity separation with toEntity() conversion methods
